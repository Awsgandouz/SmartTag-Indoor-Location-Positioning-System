# Indoor-Location-Positioning-System
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and versatile indoor positioning system for tracking objects or individuals within a confined space. The ESP32 UWB module, which we imported from China, serves as the core technology for our system.

Key features of our Indoor Positioning System:

ESP32 UWB Module: The ESP32-based UWB module provides precise ranging capabilities, enabling accurate tracking and localization within a range of approximately 10cm.

Smart Shin Guard: We have integrated the ESP32 UWB module into a shin guard, transforming it into a SmartTag. The SmartTag can be worn by players on a football field, allowing real-time tracking of their movements.

Versatile Application: While initially designed for football field tracking, our Indoor Positioning System can be extended to any indoor tracking and localization system. It has the potential to be applied in various domains, such as sports arenas, warehouses, and more.
